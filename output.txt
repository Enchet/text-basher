echo I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name
wait(1)
echo  But I'm afraid you've been misinformed
wait(1)
echo  You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume
wait(1)
echo  Although you have indeed been called
wait(1)
echo You have all been called here
wait(1)
echo  Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune
wait(1)
echo  A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize
wait(1)
echo  You don't even realize that you are trapped
wait(1)
echo  Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach
wait(1)
echo But you will never find them, none of you will
wait(1)
echo  This is where your story ends
wait(1)
echo And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you
wait(1)
echo  Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want
wait(1)
echo  I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be
wait(1)
echo  I am remaining as well, I am nearby
wait(1)
echo This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away
wait(1)
echo  As the agony of every tragedy should
wait(1)
echo  And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you
wait(1)
echo For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears
wait(1)
echo  Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend
wait(1)
echo My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well
wait(1)
echo  It's in your nature to protect the innocent
wait(1)
echo  I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours
wait(1)
echo  And then, what became of you
wait(1)
echo I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter
wait(1)
echo  I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now
wait(1)
echo It's time to rest
wait(1)
echo  For you, and for those you have carried in your arms
wait(1)
echo This ends for all of us
wait(1)
echo End communication
wait(1)
